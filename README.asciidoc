## Dependencies

Mostly, we set up the dependencies so that 
link:https://github.com/clojure/tools.logging[clojure.tools.logging], 
uses link:http://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J] and 
link:http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback].

We also include the link:http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html#jclOverSLF4J[shim library] 
that converts 
link:http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/[Apache Commons Logging] to use SLF4J as well.

## Setup

The namespace io.aviso.logging.setup performs all the necessary setup; it installs
link:https://github.com/AvisoNovate/pretty[pretty exception reporting] for console output
and commons logging output, as well as a default uncaught exception handler (that logs the 
uncaught exception).
 
Simply have some part of your application require this namespace. 

## Request Correlation
 
Ever try to trace a request from a client through a cluster of services?
Even if you can get all the logs in one place, how do you pick out the single thread of
requests and responses from all the other requests and responses?

With request correlation, each request gets assigned a correlation id on entry to the system.
When one server sends a request to another server, it includes the correlation id as a header
on the request.

That, plus a little bit of logic in your Logback configuration, allows every request to be flagged.

### Request Correlation Middleware

The function io.aviso.logging.correlation/wrap-with-request-correlation is a Ring middleware function;
it is passed a Ring request handler and wraps it.

On each request, the request correlation id is extracted, or generated if not present.
By default, the correlation id comes from the Correlation-Id header, and is generated
as a random UUID if not present.

In addition, the io.aviso.logging.correlation/\*correlation-id* Var is bound to the correlation id.
This little bit of semi-global state can be used when making requests to other servers,
to include the correlation id in the request.

### Logging the Correlation Id

The final piece of the puzzle is to get the correlation id logged. 
this is accomplished by making the correlation id a
link:http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html[mapped diagnostic context].

In your logback.xml (or logback-test.xml):


[source,xml]
----
    <appender name="SETUP-MDC" class="io.aviso.logging.CorrelationIdAppender"/>

    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%date{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %mdc{correlation-id} %-5level [%thread] %logger{} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="info">
        <appender-ref ref="SETUP-MDC"/>
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </root>
----

The CorrelationIdAppended is used to set up the correlation id into the MDC (the mapped
diagnostic context).
After that, the `%mdc{correlation-id}` form can extract that value and include it in the
logged output.
